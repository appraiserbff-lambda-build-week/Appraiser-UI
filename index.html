                    <h2>About the App</h2>
                    <p>Real estate owners, investment managers, and appraisers have a vested interest in being able to
                        better
                        understand,
                        track, and record property values. Users might only want to know what the value is currently,
                        what
                        it’s
                        been over a
                        specific period of time, or get more in-depth knowledge behind the numbers. While other
                        sites/apps
                        can
                        provide pieces of
                        this information, our app will solve the problem of aggregating it into one user-friendly
                        interface.

                    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                    <p>We believe the real estate industry is needlessly opaque and difficult to operate it. Our
                        application
                        is
                        dedicated to
                        bringing simplicity back, cutting through the confusing, and bringing all the relevant info into
                        one
                        house, so you can
                        rest more easily in your house.</p>
